# The Heartbeat Problem: Abstract

A mathematical model of the heartbeat, employing a discrete-time framework implemented through MATLAB code. This model follows a threshold mechanism for triggering the electrochemical wave that induces ventricular contraction (systole) and accurately reflects the rapid transition to relaxation (diastole) post-contraction. By formulating a system of discrete-time equations derived from the underlying differential equation model, we depict the dynamic behaviour of heart fibre length (x) and electrical conductance (b) over time. Our analysis reveals that a ventricular contraction or heartbeat, corresponds to a swift decrease in heart fibre length as the ventricular muscles contract to pump blood. The triggering of contraction is governed by a predefined threshold value of electrical conductance, indicative of the heart's electrical potential reaching a critical level. The MATLAB simulations demonstrate a coherent pattern where the rapid increase in electrical potential coincides with the contraction phase, facilitating the efficient ejection of blood from the heart into the circulatory system. This model was utilized to explore patterns of irregular heartbeats characteristic of various human diseases. This offers valuable insights into the mechanistic complexity of the heartbeat, with implications for understanding cardiovascular dynamics and potential applications in medical interventions and health management strategies.
